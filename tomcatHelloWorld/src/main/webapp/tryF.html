    The 3rd Maxwell's Equation<br />

        On this page, we'll explain the meaning of the 3rd of Maxwell's Equations,
        <b>Faraday's Law</b>, which is given in Equation [1]:

        Faraday was a scientist experimenting with circuits and magnetic coils way back in the
        1830s.  His experiment setup, which led to Farday's Law, is shown in Figure 1:

            <font color="blue">Figure 1.  Experimental Setup For Faraday.</font>
        </p>
    </center>
    <p align="justify">
        The experiment itself is somewhat simple.  When the battery is disconnected,
        we have no electric current flowing through the wire.  Hence there is no magnetic
        flux induced within the Iron (Magnetic Core).  The Iron is like a highway for
        Magnetic Fields - they flow very easily through magnetic material.  So the purpose
        of the core is to create a path for the Magnetic Flux to flow.

    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        When the switch is closed, the electric current will flow within the wire
        attached to the battery.  When this current flows, it has an associated magnetic
        field (or magnetic flux) with it.  When the wire wraps around the left side of the
        magnetic core (as shown in <span class="link" id="fig1">
        Figure 1</span>), a magnetic field (magnetic flux) is induced
        within the core.  This flux travels around the core.  So the Magnetic Flux
        produced by the wired coil on the left exists within the wired coil on the right,
        which is connected to the ammeter.

</p>
    <p align="justify">
        Now, a funny thing happens, which Faraday observed.  When he closed the switch,
        then current would begin flowing and the ammeter would spike one way (say measuring
        +10 Amps on the other side).  But this was very brief, and the current on the
        right coil would go to zero.  When the switch was opened, the measured current
        would spike to the other side (say -10 Amps would be measured), and then
        the measured current on the right side would again be zero.

    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Faraday figured out what was happening.  When the switch was initially changed
        from open to closed, the magnetic flux within the magnetic core increased
        from zero to some maximum number (which was a constant value, versus time).
        When the flux was increasing, there existed an induced current on the opposite
        side.

    </p>

    <p align="justify">
        Similarly, when the switch was opened, the magnetic flux in the core would decrease
        from it's constant value back to zero.  Hence, a decreasing flux within the
        core induced an opposite current on the right side.

    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Faraday figured out that a changing Magnetic Flux within a circuit (or closed loop
        of wire) produced an induced <i>EMF</i>, or voltage within the circuit.  He
        wrote this as:

        within a circuit, and <i>EMF</i> is the electro-motive force, which is basically
        a voltage source.  <span class="link" id="eq2">Equation [2]</span> then says that the induced voltage in a circuit
        is the opposite of the time-rate-of-change of the magnetic flux.

        Deriving Faraday's Law<br>

        Now after the experiment in <span class="link" id="fig1">Figure 1</span>, we have the experimental result of <span class="link" id="eq2">Equation [2]</span>,
        how do we go from this result to the standard form of Farday's Law in <a class="link" id="eq1">Equation [1]</a>?
        Well, I'm glad you asked. Let's imagine a simple loop, with a time varying <a class="link" id="B">B</a>


        We know that the rate of change of the total magnetic flux is equal
        to the opposite of the <a class="link" id="EMF">EMF</a>, or the electric force within the wire.
        The total magnetic flux is simply the integral (or sum) of the
        field over the area enclosed by the wire: field within it: Equation3:

        We know that the rate of change of the total magnetic flux is equal to the opposite

        To find the total <i>EMF</i> induced around the whole circuit, we sum up
        over the length of the wire the <i>EMF</i> produced at each point.  This is known
        as a line integral.  This is written as:

        Now, recall that the
        <a href="http://maxwells-equations.com/fields/electric.php">Electric Field is directly related to force from electric charges</a>.
        And Voltage is also defined as the sum (integral) of the Electric Field across a path
        [recall that the E-field is measured in Volts/meter].  Hence, the E-field is
        actually the spatial-derivative of voltage (E-field is equal to the rate of change of the voltage with respect to distance).
        These facts are summed up in the following:

        Hence, Equations <span class="link" id="eq4">[4]</span> and <span class="link" id="eq5">[5]</span> tell us that the differential amount of <i>EMF</i>
        at any point along the circuit (<i>dEMF</i> in [4]) is equal to the <b>E</b>
        field at that location.  Therefore:

        Now, some mathematician named Stokes figured out that integrating (averaging)
        of a field around a loop is exactly equivalent to integrating the
        <a href="http://www.maxwells-equations.com/curl/curl.php">curl</a> of the field within
        the loop.  This should have somewhat of an intuitive truth to you: the curl is
        the measure of the rotation of a field, so the curl of a vector field within a
        surface should be related to the integral of a field around a loop that encloses the
        surface.  If it doesn't make sense, think about it more or just accept the following
        as truth (because it is true - not just for <b>E</b> fields but for any field):

        Now we are almost there.  If we replace Farday's Law of <span class="link" id="eq2">
        Equation [2]</span>, with the
        terms we found in <span class="link" id="eq3">Equation [3]</span> and <span class="link" id="eq7">Equation [7]</span>, then we get:

        In <span class="link" id="eq8">Equation [8]</span>, we note that if we have two integrals over surfaces, and the
        surfaces can be however we choose, then the quantities we integrate must also
        be the same.  And this is how we obtained Faraday's Law in final form, as
        listed on Maxwell's Equations!
